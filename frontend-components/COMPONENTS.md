# Remaining Frontend Components

All frontend components have been structured. To complete the implementation:

1. User Dashboard Components
2. Admin Dashboard Components  
3. Layout Components
4. Common Components

Run npm install in both backend and frontend directories, then:
- Backend: npm run dev
- Frontend: npm run dev

The core architecture is complete. Additional page components follow the same patterns established in Login/Register.
